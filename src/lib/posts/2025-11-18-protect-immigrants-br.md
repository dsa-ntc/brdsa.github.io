Faith and community advocates across Louisiana are calling for compassion, transparency, and accountability as immigration enforcement actions continue to separate families and destabilize communities.

Residents from Kenner, New Orleans, LaPlace, Slidell, Lafayette, Denham Springs, Baton Rouge, and surrounding areas report that parents and workers — including individuals with legal status, work permits, or pending petitions for permanent residency — are being detained and deported. These actions are leaving US-born children and US citizens spouses without emotional or financial support, and in some cases, without a home.

“These are parents, workers, and neighbors who strengthen our communities,” said one advocate. “When a breadwinner is taken away, it’s not only a legal issue, it’s a moral one.”

Community members have also voiced growing concern about local law enforcement collaborating with federal immigration authorities, and are urging state and local leaders to ensure that such partnerships include oversight, transparency, and due process protections.

In one example, a mother with no criminal record was deported despite being the family's only source of income. Now her child, an 18-year-old US-born university student, is struggling to balance studies, rent, and full-time work while facing deep emotional distress.

Another case involves a 13-year-old girl in Baton Rouge whose father was detained on his way to work. He had promised to celebrate her quinceañera, a milestone fifteenth birthday, but now sits in detention. “Even if I have a party,” she told friends, “It won’t be the same without my dad for the father-daughter dance.”

The impact reaches deep into Louisiana’s schools. Teachers and counselors report that students are increasingly afraid that their parents may not be home when the students return from school. Some middle school students have even considered dropping out to work so their parents won’t have to risk going to work and being detained.

“As a community and as people of faith, we must ask ourselves what kind of society we are building when children live with that kind of fear,” said one community member. “This is not humane. This is not what God calls us to be.”

Citing Scripture, advocates point to Deuteronomy 10:18–19, which reminds believers that God “defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger,” and Matthew 25:35–40, in which Jesus teaches that caring for the vulnerable is a reflection of serving Him.

“As a Christian, I believe we are called to act with mercy and justice,” said another faith leader. “When families are torn apart, children are left to suffer the consequences of decisions they didn’t make. We can and must choose compassion.”

Faith and community advocates are urging Governor Jeff Landry, Louisiana’s congressional delegation, and local officials to:

- Ensure transparency and oversight where local agencies collaborate with federal immigration enforcement.
- Mayor-President Edwards and all other mayors should refuse any local law enforcement collaboration with ICE and federal troops.
- Uphold due process and fairness for every person, including those facing immigration proceedings.
- Pursue humane, family-centered policies that keep families together and reflect the values of compassion, justice, and faith:
* Ending the deportation of parents with US citizen children
* Mental health support for children in schools
* Supporting children under provisional custody in applying to higher education

“This is not about politics,” said one advocate. “It’s about living out our faith through fairness, mercy, and love of neighbor. No child should go to bed wondering if their parent will be taken away. We believe Louisiana can lead with both justice and heart.”
